## Program to do Bill of Materials analysis
For instance if a hypothetical fan assembly requires four screws, a fan
housing, a motor and a fan impeller, and a motor requires a stator, eight
screws and a rotor, and a rotor requires four screws an armature and two coils,
and a stator requires two armatures, eight screws and four coils then the
completely expanded Bill of Materials will show the following:
- 24 screws
- 1 fan housing
- 1 fan impeller
- 3 armatures
- 6 coils
